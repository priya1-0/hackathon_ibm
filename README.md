Short description

What's the problem?
According to the United Nations, there are around 690 million people are hungry, which mounts for 10 percent of the world’s population. One in every nine people goes to bed hungry each night. It is not just providing food to all. It is to provide clean, healthy and nutrition food and water. The world has made great progress in reducing hunger: But there is still a long way to go, and no one organization can achieve Zero Hunger if it works alone. Governments, citizens, civil society organizations and the private sector must collaborate to invest, innovate and create lasting solutions.

According to our research, the problems are Malnutrition, Food wastage, Poverty, agricultural productivity, sustainable food production plants and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, etc,. The agriculture community is loaded with other difficulties as well. The biggest trouble is that the farmers don’t get the price they deserve for their produce. This is basically a result of numerous intermediaries. Lower returns compel them to take credits that they can’t support, driving them further into poverty. Solution is to increase the production in agriculture with lower inputs and higher yields. This will encourage the farmers and eradicate them from migrating to other jobs.

How can technology help?
Technology can answer most difficulties farmers face. It can assist them with harvest wisely and carefully, decrease the use of water, increase yield and their net profit margins by directly selling the crops in the market at a higher rate. Donations from donors can help eradicate poverty by means of technology. Technology can help make precise predictions for upcoming seasons to come. Also if more nodes recording the climatic changes are deployed then it can add to the network to even further help predict uncertainties.

The idea
It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

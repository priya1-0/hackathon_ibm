A basic GitHub repository example for new Call for Code projects and those that join the Call for Code with The Linux Foundation deployment initiative. Not all sections or files are required. You can make this as simple or as in-depth as you need. And don't forget to register for Call for Code 2021!

If you're new to open source, please consider taking the free "Introduction to Open Source" class.

Short description
What's the problem?
Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

How can technology help?
Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

The idea
It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

The architecture
Video transcription/translation app

The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
